        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a PhD student in Geography at the
            <a href="https://www.unm.edu/" target="_blank">University of New Mexico</a>,
            specializing in spatial analysis, remote sensing, and urban sustainability. My research focuses on
            leveraging geospatial technologies to analyze urban heat islands, environmental monitoring, and
            transportation planning.
        </p>
        <p>Previously, I worked as a researcher at the
            <a href="https://www.fh-kaernten.at/en/" target="_blank">Carinthia University of Applied Sciences</a>,
            where I contributed to building footprint digitization projects in Austria. I also conducted research at
            the
            <a href="https://www.unm.edu/" target="_blank">University of New Mexico</a>,
            utilizing remote sensing technology to analyze urban heat islands across various cities.
        </p>
        <p>My professional experience includes serving as a spatial data analyst at
            <a href="https://www.dynamicgroupco.com/" target="_blank">Dynamic Kariz System Design and Architecture
                Company</a>
            in Tehran, Iran, where I was involved in developing national geolocation and navigation systems.
            Additionally, I worked as an urban development engineer at
            <a href="https://www.naghshine.com/" target="_blank">Naghshine Mandegar Engineering Office</a>,
            overseeing construction projects.
        </p>
        <p>My technical expertise includes Google Earth Engine, Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and
            Leaflet, as well as GIS platforms such as ArcGIS. I specialize in geospatial data processing, remote
            sensing analysis, and web-based mapping applications.</p>
        <p>I hold an MSc in Spatial Information Management from
            <a href="https://www.fh-kaernten.at/en/" target="_blank">Carinthia University of Applied Sciences</a>,
            an MSc in Urban Design from

            routine. I love Queen and I named my cat Freddie, so his meow most likely is a song. The fun fact about
            me is I am the one who crosses the border just for having the best cup of coffee or an ice cream in the
            world.</p>
